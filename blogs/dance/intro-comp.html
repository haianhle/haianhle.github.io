                    <h2>An introduction to competitive ballroom</h2>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                    <i>(I posted this article on Wordpress a while back and will repost it here.)</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Competitive ballroom, or sometimes called dancesport is, well, considered a "sport".
                    According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancesport">Wikipedia</a>,
                    the purpose of the term "dancesport" is to help competitive ballroom
                    gain Olympic recognition. 
                    So far, attempts to have ballroom included in the Olympic programme have been 
                    to no avail, but I guess one can always hope. I don't think I have a very
                    strong opinion on this matter, but even more so than figure skating,
                    I think it will be hard to come up with a fair judging system that
                    does not affect the artistry at the same time.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <center><img src="dancesport.jpg" width="80%"></img></center>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                    Dancesport is regulated by official dancesport organizations, such as the 
                    World DanceSport Federation or the World Dance Council.
                    Some styles, such as Waltz and Foxtrot, have been around for a while, 
                    many other dance styles have only been added in the recent past. 
                    In North America, there are two styles of ballroom dancing: 
                    International style and American style. 
                    Although the latter has become more and more popular, the labels 
                    American and International styles are used primarily in North America. 
                    The rest of the world only knows International Style, 
                    and so the word “international’’ can often be safely dropped. 
                    If you live outside of the US or Canada, you should just be aware of 
                    their existence and pay attention when looking up dance steps or music 
                    from different sources, as many dances exist in both an International style 
                    version and an American style version.
                    However, adding a note here, since this post was written,
                    American Smooth and Rhythm have been added to Blackpool competitions.
                    It will not be surprising if these styles become a lot popular internationally
                    in the near future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In short, ballroom dance is usually divided into 4 categories:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>International Standard:
                        Waltz, Tango, Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep and Viennese Waltz
                        </li>
                    <li>International Latin: 
                        Rumba, Cha Cha, Samba, Jive and Paso Doble
                        </li>
                    <li>American Smooth:
                        Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Viennese Waltz
                        </li>
                    <li>American Rhythm:
                        Rumba, Cha Cha, Swing, Mambo, and Bolero
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    International Standard and American Smooth are commonly referred to as ballroom.
                    In all of these dances, the man and woman are in dance frame/hold. 
                    The dances all progress around the dance floor. 
                    The different dance styles have different music, tempi, holds, and characteristics. 
                    American Smooth is more similar to International Standard than it is to 
                    International Latin or American Rhythm; 
                    the most striking difference is perhaps in the dance hold. 
                    A closed hold is maintained throughout in International Standard, 
                    while an open-hold is very often seen in American Smooth. 
                    However, despite the similarity, when taking a closer look, some dances can
                    have quite a different feel in these two styles, for example,
                    slow (international) Foxtrot versus American Foxtrot. 
                    American Rhythm more closely resembles International Latin, 
                    although the footwork can be significantly different at a more advanced level. 
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <h4>Amateur ballroom competitions in the US</h4>
                    <p>
                    In ballroom competitions, dancers are judged by many criteria, 
                    from timing, poise, frame, posture, to shape, musicality, expression, and presentation. 
                    Of course, there are people who started dancing before learning how to ride 
                    a bicycle, who often become professional dancers,
                    and those like us, who started as adults. 
                    The good news is recreational dancers are judged at different skill levels, 
                    which are divided into two major categories in amateur/pro-am competitions: 
                    syllabus and open. 
                    The syllabus category is further divided into 3 levels from less to more advanced:
                    Bronze, Silver, and Gold. 
                    Dancers in the syllabus levels have to follow certain syllabi depending on 
                    the rules of a particular competition. 
                    Competitors are therefore strongly advised to read the Rulebook before registering. 
                    More sub-levels exist in certain competitions, such as pre-Bronze, 
                    intermediate-Bronze, full-Bronze, open-Bronze, etc. 
                    Some competitions also have a Newcomer category for dancers with less than one year 
                    of dancing or competition experience. 
                    The open category is divided into 2 or 3 levels, depending on the competition: 
                    Pre-Champ and Champ; or Novice, Pre-Champ, and Champ. 
                    Although various point systems exist to prevent advanced dancers from dancing at 
                    levels below their ability, most of the time dancers decide for themselves 
                    which levels they want to enter. 
                    Most competitions allow registering for two consecutive levels, 
                    for example, Newcomer and Bronze, Silver and Gold, or Gold and Novice. 
                    Dancers are also advised to check the Rulebook for rules/restrictions on costume/attire. 
                    Most USADance competitions did not allow full gowns/costumes/tailcoats at syllabus levels
                    in the past, but that rule has been relaxed now.
                    More information on different competitions, rules and regulations, syllabi, etc., 
                    can be found on the websites of 
                    <a href="https://www.ndca.org">NDCA (National Dance Council of America)</a> and 
                    <a href="http://www.usadance.org">USA Dance</a>

                    <h4>Blackpool: the WorldCup of Dancesport</h4>
                    <p>
                    <a href="http://www.blackpooldancefestival.com">
                    Blackpool Dance Festival</a>,
                    held in May at Winter Gardens, Blackpool, is considered the biggest, 
                    oldest, and most prestigious dance competition for the International styles. 
                    As mentioned earlier, American styles have been recently added to the competition.
                    The 2019 Blackpool is held from May 23 to 31. As of April 2019,
                    Arunas Bizokas and Katusha Demidova are the Pro Standard champions,
                    and have been for many years. Victor Fung and Anastasia Muravyeva became
                    champions for the first time in 2017 when Arunas and Katusha had to miss the final. 
                    Riccardo Cocchi and Yulia Zagoruychenko have been Pro Latin champions
                    since 2016 after Michael Malitowski and Joanna Leunis retired.
                    In 2015, the very first American smooth showcase was presented at Blackpool on its 90th anniversary,
                    and American styles had been added to the compeitions afterwards.
                    As of April 2019, Nick Cheremukhin and Viktorija Barasihina are the champions
                    in  Pro Smooth, and Andre Paramonov and Natalie Paramonov are the
                    champions in Pro Rhythm.
